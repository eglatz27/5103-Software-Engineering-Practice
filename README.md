This code will perform the calculation of the statistics of a given word within a given block of text. The code will find the frequency of each unique word within the text. The code treats space, tabs and newline characters as seperators.

Simply run the code within a Python compiler and type in or copy and paste the text when requested by the program.

All test cases mentioned within the requirenments are addressed within the .py file.

UPDATE 4/30: All test cases have been moved to a seperate .py file named "Test_Cases.py" to assist in readability within the mains code file.

Thank you.
